Check back soon to see the updated blog post!


Over the winter break, I've been given the opportunity to go to Europe for Christmas. The original plan was to finish my exams early and fly straight to Zurich followed by Interlaken. Unfortunately all my exams were very late so I missed out on Zurich. I will be back to explore Zurich!  

In short, I fell in love with Switzerland. There's just something about this country that feels surreal. 

I landed in Zuirch and then caught the train straight to Interlaken. It was a two hour journey that was both smooth and comfortable. By the time I arrive, it was already dark. The hotel I was staying at was a short five minute walk from the train station. Basically spent the first night here exploring the small town. 












### Did you know Switzerland has four offical languages? 
They are German, French, Italian, and Romansh
